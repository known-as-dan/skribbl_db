# About
This is a pile-of-shit python database front-end that was meant to fulfil a boring idea and was written on a whim.
You basically just add words as you play skribbl.io, hoping that at some point you'll have every word available to you.

A javascript object(json) is used to store all words, in order to make a Github Pages word search website possible.
# Usage
```
search <length> <spaces> [characters...] Search for words that match a certain criteria.

add <word> Add a word to the database.

remove <word> Remove a word from the database.
```
